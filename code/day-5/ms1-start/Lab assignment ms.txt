In this lab assignment you have two services namely coupon and product.
 The product service will be used to get the product details and the coupon 
 service will be used to get the coupon details.

 You can invoke the coupon services as follows:
 http://localhost:8083/coupon/SUP10
 
 It will return the following response:
 {
   "couponCode": "SUP10",
   "discountPercentage": 10,
   "expiredOn": "2025-02-01T06:08:49.6702893"
 }
 similarly you can invoke the coupon service to get discount for SUP15 and SUP20

 You can invoke the product services as follows:

 http://localhost:8082/products/1
 It will return the following response:
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Laptop",
  "description": "Dell",
  "price": 100000,
  "discountCoupon": null,
  "discountedPrice": null
}
You can see that we are getting discounted price and dicounted coupon is null

step 1: change above api and take discount coupon from the user as

http://localhost:8082/products?id=1&couponCode=SUP10

Now call coupon-service api to get discount for SUP10 using open feign and show both discounted price and dicounted coupon

{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Laptop",
  "description": "Dell",
  "price": 100000,
  "discountCoupon": "SUP10",
  "discountedPrice": 90000
}

step 2: we are calling coupon service and product service directly. 
we should use eureka server instead of calling directly


step 3: we are using hard coded url while using open feign. 
we should apply spring cloud gateway so that all  request will go through gateway


step 4: Provide some fallback respone using resilence 4j in case of coupon service is down

Ports:
coupon: 8083
product: 8082
eureka: 8761
api-gateway: 8080

step 5: we want to externalized the configuration of the prject : config service


Step 6: We want to do application performance monitoring etc
	Prometheus and Grafana
	Prometheus collects and stores metrics → Grafana visualizes them.
	
Step 7: Sluth and zipkin
	Sleuth generates & propagates trace info → Zipkin collects & visualizes it.
	
Step 8: ELK stack
	ELK Stack = Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana
	Loki and tempo is better and lightwt cloud native alternative*

Step 9: OAuth2 on top of this 
	Keyclock server
