Spring boot reactive programming:
---------------------------------
What is Reactive Programming?
	Reactive Programming is a programming paradigm focused on asynchronous, 
	non-blocking, and event-driven data processing. 
	
	It allows systems to react to data as it becomes available ‚Äî like user actions, 
	sensor inputs, or web requests ‚Äî using a stream-based approach.

At its core, it is about:
-----------------------
	Non-blocking execution
	Backpressure handling
	Asynchronous data flow using streams of events

Why Do We Need Reactive Programming?
------------------------------
In modern applications, especially microservices, we face:

	High concurrency
	Real-time user interactions
	Network latency
	I/O-heavy tasks (database, API calls)

Traditional blocking I/O (like using RestTemplate or JDBC) consumes a thread per request, 
which does not scale well under high load.

Reactive programming solves this by:
---------------------------------------
	Freeing up threads for more work while waiting for I/O
	Providing better scalability and resource efficiency
	Handling thousands of concurrent connections with fewer resources

Reactive Programming in Spring Boot (Spring WebFlux)
-------------------------------------
Spring Boot supports reactive programming through Spring WebFlux, introduced in Spring 5.

Key Components:

Mono<T>: Represents 0 or 1 item (like Optional).
Flux<T>: Represents 0 to N items (like a List or stream).


WebClient: Reactive alternative to RestTemplate.

Netty-based non-blocking server (Reactor Netty by default).

When to Use Reactive in Spring Boot?
--------------------------------
Use Spring WebFlux (reactive):

When you expect high concurrency and I/O-bound operations (e.g., APIs hitting databases, other services).
For event-driven, streaming, or real-time applications (e.g., chat apps, stock tickers).

When you want better scalability with fewer threads (e.g., cloud-native apps).

When NOT to Use It?
----------------
Avoid reactive:
For CPU-intensive tasks (reactive won‚Äôt help).
When using blocking libraries like traditional JDBC (unless you use R2DBC or a reactive DB driver).
If your team is not familiar with reactive concepts ‚Äî it has a learning curve.



In Spring Boot Reactive applications (using Spring WebFlux), you have two styles to define endpoints:
---------------------------------------------------------
Functional Endpoints 
Traditional (Annotation-based) Endpoints

Feature				Traditional Endpoint					Functional Endpoint
Style				Annotation-based (like Spring MVC)		Lambda/functional style
Annotation			@RestController, @GetMapping, etc		No annotations ‚Äî uses RouterFunction and HandlerFunction
Code Structure		Declarative and OOP-friendly			More programmatic and functional
Readability			Easier for most Java developers			Concise but less readable for beginners
Flexibility			Standard structure						Highly flexible (like defining DSLs)
Use Case			CRUD APIs, familiar style				Complex routing logic, lightweight handlers

Traditional (Annotation-based) Endpoint
------------------------------
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/products")
public class ProductController {

    @Autowired
    private ProductService service;

    @GetMapping
    public Flux<Product> getAll() {
        return service.getAllProducts();
    }

    @PostMapping
    public Mono<Product> save(@RequestBody Product p) {
        return service.saveProduct(p);
    }
}


Functional Endpoint
-----------------------

@Component
public class ProductHandler {

    public Mono<ServerResponse> getAll(ServerRequest request) {
        Flux<Product> products = ... // from service
        return ServerResponse.ok().body(products, Product.class);
    }

    public Mono<ServerResponse> save(ServerRequest request) {
        Mono<Product> productMono = request.bodyToMono(Product.class);
        return productMono
            .flatMap(p -> ... ) // save and return
            .flatMap(saved -> ServerResponse.ok().bodyValue(saved));
    }
}


Router:
------------
@Configuration
public class ProductRouter {

    @Bean
    public RouterFunction<ServerResponse> route(ProductHandler handler) {
        return RouterFunctions
                .route(GET("/products"), handler::getAll)
                .andRoute(POST("/products"), handler::save);
    }
}
When to Use Which?
------------------
Scenario									Recommendation
Familiar with Spring MVC					Use traditional
Need clear separation of concerns			Use traditional
Want DSL-like routing, no annotations		Use functional
Building lightweight, composable APIs		Use functional
Migrating existing Spring MVC app			Stick with traditional



do functional have better performance?
------------------------------------------
In theory:
-----------
üî∏ Functional endpoints are slightly more lightweight 
		than annotation-based ones.
		
üî∏ They skip the reflection and annotation processing 
		overhead involved in @RestController, @RequestMapping, etc.

In practice:
-----------------
	‚úÖ The performance difference is minimal ‚Äî in most real-world applications, 
	it‚Äôs not significant enough to be the sole reason for choosing one over the other.

Why Functional May Perform Slightly Better
-------------------------------------------
	No annotation scanning at startup
	No method-level reflection during request handling
	Pure functional composition using RouterFunction and HandlerFunction

But...
	‚û°Ô∏è Spring's annotation-based model is highly optimized, 
	and the overhead is measured in microseconds.



üß™ Benchmark Insight (Simplified)
-----------------------------------------
Metric							Annotation-based		Functional
Startup time (small app) 		~5-10ms longer			Slightly faster
Request throughput				Similar (~99.5% same)	Slight edge for functional
Memory usage					Almost identical	Functional uses a bit less



‚úÖ When Performance Matters
-------------------------------------
Choose functional endpoints only if:

	You‚Äôre building a high-performance, 
	minimal API (e.g., a gateway, router, or data streaming service)

	You prefer functional composition and DSL-style routing

	Otherwise, for clarity, maintainability, 
	and team familiarity, annotation-based is usually better.


Final Recommendation
------------------------
Use functional endpoints if:

	You want DSL-style control
	You‚Äôre building a low-overhead, high-throughput reactive service
	Stick with annotation-based if:
	Your team is familiar with Spring MVC style
	You want easier readability and structure
